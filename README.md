# networkTopologyMatrices
the purpose of this project is to calculate the current and the voltage in every branch in the graph that the user provides. using tie-set matrix or cut-set matrix.
## Technologies
* java 11
* javafx

## how to use
draw the graph using the elements (node - branch - link):
* to draw:
 1. node: select node and then click anywhere in the drawing area 
 2. twig(branch) or link: select (branch or link) then click in the start node and then click in the end node, after that a pop-up dialog will appear to provide the current,    voltage, and (impedances or admittances) for the branch.
 note: for admittances add 's' to the end.
